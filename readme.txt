you just need to edit 4 lines to make it working. in "usr.txt" on the first line enter your
 gmail uddres, (example firstname.lastname@gmail.com), on the second line enter google app
 password. You can create it here - https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords. The third
 line showes who is sender (for example Jhon Snow).

 In "recipient.txt" enter email of recipient.
